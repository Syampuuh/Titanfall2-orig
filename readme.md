### Future Content:
*(note: details are somewhat speculatory based on sparse amounts of game code and text bank tokens)*

* New Titan: **Monarch**
  * *"Mid-range Vanguard-class Titan that can upgrade itself on the battlefield."*
  * Likely exclusive to Frontier Defense, god help us all if she isn't
  * Primary Weapon: XO-16 Chaingun. "20mm armor piercing automatic rifle." You know what it is
  * Offensive: Rocket Salvo. "Launches an unguided rocket swarm."
  * Defensive: Energy Siphon (internally, Stun Laser). "Slows enemies and generates Shields. Heavily armored targets generate more Shield." Seems to be a laser shot with these effects
  * Utility: Rearm. "Refreshes the cooldown of your Dash, Ordnance, and Defensive Ability."
  * Core: Upgrade Core. "Recharges your Titan's shields and upgrades your Titan in order of the upgrades above."
    * ***Level 1***
      * **Arc Rounds** - Increases ammo capacity and XO-16 rounds break through Defensive Abilities.
	    * Increases magazine capacity from 30 to 40 and seems to go through all shields
      * **Missile Racks** - Rocket Salvo fires twice the amount of missiles.
	    * As found earlier, 12 rockets per salvo instead of 6
      * **Energy Field** - Energy Siphon affects a large area around the point of impact.
	    * As found earlier, Energy Siphon's explosion radius increases from 3 feet to 25 feet
    * ***Level 2***
      * **Swift Rearm** - Rearm is almost instantaneous.
	    * As found earlier, 0.1 second activation time instead of 0.5 seconds
      * **Maelstrom** - Electric Smoke is intensified, dealing more damage to Titans and Pilots.
	    * As found earlier, increases Electric Smoke DPS against Pilots from 45 to 90 and DPS against Titans from 450 to 1350
      * **Energy Transfer** - Energy Siphon gives Shield to friendly Titans.
    * ***Level 3***
      * **Multi-Target Missiles** - Rocket Salvo can lock onto Titans and Reapers. Missiles fly faster and deal more damage.
	    * Apparently not yet implemented, I presume they are working on getting the MTMS to not lock onto human sized targets
      * **Superior Chassis** - Upgrades Monarch's health, dash, and melee capabilities.
	    * Not yet implemented, and no numbers to be found yet.
      * **XO-16 Battle Rifle** - Unlocks the hidden power of the XO-16, increasing precision, damage, and critical damage.
	    * Not yet implemented, and no numbers to be found yet.
  * Unique Titan Kits:
	* **Data Siphon** - Core Meter is earned 25% faster.
    * **Shield Amplifier** - Increases your Titan's max shield strength by 50%
	  * This would mean a shield with 3750 HP rather than 2500.
    * **Rapid Rearm** - Reduces the cooldown of Rearm by 5 seconds.
    * **Survival of the Fittest** - Batteries can repair the Monarch out of Doomed State.
    * **Apex Titan** - Enables a fourth and final upgrade.
	  * Apparently not yet implemented, with no fourth upgrade to be found just yet
    * No apparent fifth kit yet
  * There's even a Prime model in the item database
  * There are separate voice entries for "Vanguard" and "BT", I'd bet that BT will be the Prime voice
* Coop Bounty Hunt development continues, having now been fully rebranded internally as **Frontier Defense**, with some new NPC classes added for the mode:
  * No clear indications yet what Elite Guards are; my bet's on Shield Captains, but for now it's only clear that they have a new model
  * Specialists seems to be using the Phase Shift pilot model, spawn with L-STARs and *ticks* as an ordnance
  * Mortar Titans and Nuke Titans seem to be returning, using Tone and Scorch as their bases respectively
  * There's also a "Sandbox" NPC class that is likely an AI test dummy, with a Sandbox PVE mode also added for devs
  * Harvester will be the defense objective once more, with entities added for it
  * Seems to use a MOBA-style internal leveling system, with players choosing a "path" of tactical and following upgrades to their tactical. The tacticals themselves are Phase Shift, Grapple, and... Sword Block?
    * * *Path 1* - ***The Ghost***
	  * Level 1 - **The Ghost**
        * Enter and Exit Phase Shift at Will
	  * Level 2 - **The Wisp**
	    * Fast Travel in Phase Shift
		  * More specifically, you seem to be permanently stimmed when inside the Phase realm
	  * Level 3 - **The Banshee**
	    * Destructive Exits from Phase Shift
		  * Explosions when you exit phase, with an impressive radius of 30 feet
	* *Path 2* - ***The Hook***
	  * Level 1 - **The Hook**
        * Unlimited Grapple
      * Level 2 - **The Acrobat**
        * Long-Distance Grapple
	      * Dramatically increases maximum line distance from 68 feet to 187 feet
      * Level 3 - **The Devastator**
         * Assault Grapple
	      * As found earlier, the hook explodes when making contact with surfaces
	* *Path 3* - ***The Blade***
      * Level 1 - The Blade
	    * Hold to Block, Powerful Melee
	      * Gives you a Pilot Sword for your melee, and Sword Block as your tactical. Not 100% clear on how its damage mitigation works yet
	  * Level 2 - The Assassin
		* Strike from Far Away
		  * As found earlier, drastically increases melee lunge distance from the base 8 feet to 48 feet
	  * Level 3 - The Machine Hunter
		* Effective Against Titans
		  * As found earlier, the sword's power increases and become capable of damage to Titans for 1000 damage per swing
	* *Path 4* - ***The Wall***
	  * No details currently available, but it doesn't take datamining to guess that this will be the Amped Wall's tactical path
	* *Path 5* - ***The Hound***
	  * No details currently available, but I'm willing to bet this path will belong to the Pulse Blade
	* *Path 6* - ***The Jester***
	  * No details currently available, but this should be the Holo Pilot guessing from the name
* Previously leaked modes have had code moved into their own files from the global MP properties file, development moving along
* Communications and emoticons are likely to come *very* soon, with an announcement text already being the in textbanks (https://my.mixtape.moe/rwrqqi.png) to be rolled out at any time
  * Seems it'll be a simple quick chat menu to point out objectives, commend teammates, and send emoji? No clue if it'll be voiced or anything
* Some support added for the minimap to be zoomed in or out by the player, surprised this isn't already implemented
* Seems like it'll be possible to invite friends to a network from within the game rather than having to mess with the official website

### Future Content:

*(note: details are somewhat speculatory based on sparse amounts of game code and text bank tokens)*

#### Gamemode: Hunted

* "Secure the Asset. Escape the Hunter."
* 4 on 4, 1 flag CTF?
* 1 team defending, another attacking
* Various objectives serving as "the asset", with black box to be extracted
* Prowlers and Shield Captain enemies returning from SP to help defense
* Includes weapon lockers for resupply
* No Titans, no Boosts

* 2 on 2 elimination
* Includes a unique bleedout mechanic to allow teammates to revive one another.

#### Gamemode: Co-op Bounty Hunt

* "Kill all enemy waves."
* Frontier Defense without a defense objective?
* Seems like it'll be about as harsh with enemy waves, includes resupply lockers and deployable unlocks; maybe the Engineer class equipment will finally get used?
* Confusingly, there is data such as "money earned for a player Pilot/Titan Kill"

#### Gamemode: Marked for Death

* "Kill the marked Pilot."
* Titanfall 1 returnee
* Has been sitting alongside the older mode notes for a while as a leftover from R1, but some new mode objective and score event text was added with this patch, so I think we can safely surmise that it is planned to be rereleased in R2

#### Weapon: R-101x Carbine
* "Factory issue scoped predecessor of the R-201 rifle."
* Exact same performance as R-201 but with the Titanfall 1 model (probably)
* Comes with an AOG in place of iron sights
* Entertainingly, is missing the dismemberment tag that the R-201 just had added, hopefully that's fixed before the weapon is pushed to release

* Titanfall 1 returnee

#### Map: Colony
* "IMC and Militia forces clash in the close-quarters of an uncharted rural colony."

#### Map: Township

#### Map: Traffic

#### Map: UMA

#### Map: Deck

#### Map: MOUT

#### Execution: Curb Check

* "Curb check with style using your grapple."
* Grapple rope execution, confirming the tactical-inspired execution agenda
* Seems to involve head stabbing??

#### Feature: Communication

* Some recent commented out code suggests that there is a communication wheel and unlockable emotes coming soon, or at least in development

#### Tactical: Super Phase Shift

* I have no idea. Probably a dev tool, but seems to just be Phase Shift with a duration of 999999

#### Prime Titan: Northstar

* Execution will involve probably Flight Core, using dummy versions of the Tone's tracker rockets

#### Prime Titan: Legion
