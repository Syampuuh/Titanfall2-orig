### Future Content:

*(note: details are somewhat speculatory based on sparse amounts of game code and text bank tokens)*

#### Gamemode: Hunted

* "Secure the Asset. Escape the Hunter."
* 4 on 4, 1 flag CTF?
* 1 team defending, another attacking
* Various objectives serving as "the asset", with black box to be extracted
* Prowlers and Shield Captain enemies returning from SP to help defense
* Includes weapon lockers for resupply
* No Titans, no Boosts

#### Gamemode: RAID

* "Plant a bomb at the enemy hardpoint. Protect yours from the same."
* Titanfall: Global Offensive

#### Gamemode: Double or Nothing

* "Kill both members of the enemy team."
* 2 on 2 elimination
* Includes a unique bleedout mechanic to allow teammates to revive one another.

#### Gamemode: Co-op Bounty Hunt

* "Kill all enemy waves."
* Frontier Defense without a defense objective?
* Seems like it'll be about as harsh with enemy waves, includes resupply lockers and deployable unlocks; maybe the Engineer class equipment will finally get used?
* Confusingly, there is data such as "money earned for a player Pilot/Titan Kill"

#### Gamemode: Marked for Death

* "Kill the marked Pilot."
* Titanfall 1 returnee
* Has been sitting alongside the older mode notes for a while as a leftover from R1, but some new mode objective and score event text was added with this patch, so I think we can safely surmise that it is planned to be rereleased in R2

#### Weapon: R-101x Carbine
* "Factory issue scoped predecessor of the R-201 rifle."
* Exact same performance as R-201 but with the Titanfall 1 model (probably)
* Comes with an AOG in place of iron sights
* Entertainingly, is missing the dismemberment tag that the R-201 just had added, hopefully that's fixed before the weapon is pushed to release

#### Map: Relic
* "Parts salvaged from this old IMC shipwreck are sent into the valley below for further processing."
* Titanfall 1 returnee

#### Map: Colony
* "IMC and Militia forces clash in the close-quarters of an uncharted rural colony."
* Titanfall 1 returnee

#### Map: Township

#### Map: Traffic

#### Map: UMA

#### Map: Deck

#### Map: MOUT

#### Execution: Curb Check

* "Curb check with style using your grapple."
* Grapple rope execution, confirming the tactical-inspired execution agenda
* Seems to involve head stabbing??

#### Feature: Communication

* Some recent commented out code suggests that there is a communication wheel and unlockable emotes coming soon, or at least in development

#### Tactical: Super Phase Shift

* I have no idea. Probably a dev tool, but seems to just be Phase Shift with a duration of 999999

#### Prime Titan: Northstar

* Execution will involve probably Flight Core, using dummy versions of the Tone's tracker rockets

#### Prime Titan: Legion
